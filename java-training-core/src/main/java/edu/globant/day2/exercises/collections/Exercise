- I've used collections like:

- List: 
    ArrayList:
        OnlineBanking Application to save last account movements.
        private List<movements> movements = new ArrayList<movements>();

    LinkedList:
        To save places
        List<String> city = new LinkedList<String>();
            city.add("La Plata");
            city.add("Bahia Blanca");
            city.add("Tandil");
            

-Set:
    HashSet:
    To set role to account
    private Set<Role> roles = new HashSet<Role>
